summer-report

Things I've accomplished since summer started:
    -Became comfortable with ROOT basics like fitting, plotting, etc
    -Mostly finished prelim analysis of UU data up to and not including background corrections
    -Made significant progress on analysis note and presented my results in LFSUPC

Milestones still needed:
    -Use STARsim and other software to make effective background/ efficiency corrections
    -Attempt the method of the EM field mapping paper on the uranium data
    -Finish my analysis note with more plots and all corrections

Things I have done well so far:
    -Learned many of the ins and outs of ROOT quickly
    -Picked up computer-related skills relatively quickly
    -Keeping up with having progress for group meetings each week

What I can do better:
    -Read papers faster -- I tend to be pretty slow at it
    -Coding formatting/ using the software tools at my disposal more efficiently
    -Trust my instincts more about both the physics and analysis techniques

Things my advisor can do better to make me more productive:
    -Especially bc particle won't be taught, I would like more background discussion on the physics sometimes
        -This would give me better intuition for new things to try in my analyses going forward

Things I've found interesting so far:
    -The Breit-Wheeler process -- it's pretty incredible that EM fields actually provide a valid photon source for it, it's tough to wrap my head around
    -The dark photons paper was really interesting to me - knowing we can use the data we have to improve constraints on parameters for an unknown theoretical particle is intriguing and I'd like to pursue this more at some point
    -The possiblity of helping to design/ build components for EPIC is interesting -- I'd like to hear more about what new effects we hope to observe and how the detectors actually would accomplish that

Miscellaneous notes:
    -Group meetings could be more efficient if we limited slide numbers to a certain smaller number
    -I like the frequency of 1-on-1 meetings now
    -I'll be taking QFT and TAing 2 sections so that'll set me back ~25 hours/ week. I'm guessing my productivity will be roughly cut in half but it's tough to say until I start the class
